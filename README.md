# Ensembl public databases

Typically one wouldn't need to delve into the innards of the [Ensembl public MySQL Servers](https://www.ensembl.org/info/data/mysql.html?redirect=no) because it's much easier to use Biomart. It also requires understanding the [database schema](https://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/core/core_schema.html), which is not that straightforward. However, Biomart is sometimes unreachable and/or does not work as expected. A deeper understanding of the Ensembl public databases can help in those cases since we can directly retrieve the data we want from the databases. Given my reliance on Ensembl, it is a worthwhile endeavour to try to understand the backend of Ensembl.
